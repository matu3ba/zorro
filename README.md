bit hacks and architecture-independent compiler_rt in Zig optimized for 2s complement and verified in Z3

WIP.

## structure

Folder prefixed with `p` for corresponding proofs.

- `crt` for `compiler_rt`

## todos

- [ ] figure out which license to use for bit hacks (unlicense/BSD/public domain/unlicense/MIT at your request)
- [ ] architecture-independent compiler_rt
- [ ] verify compiler_rt
- [ ] list of all bit-hacks (unlicense/BSD/public domain/MIT)
- [ ] implement common bit-hacks (unlicense/BSD/public domain/MIT)
- [ ] verify common bit-hacks (MIT)
- [ ] link or explain common theories and techniques
