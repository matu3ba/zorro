Integer bit hacks and architecture-independent compiler_rt in Zig optimized for 2s complement and verified in Z3

Code has 0BSD license, proofs have MIT license.

WIP.

## structure

Folder prefixed with `p` for corresponding proofs.

- `crt` for `compiler_rt`

## todos

- [ ] architecture-independent compiler_rt
- [ ] verify compiler_rt
- [ ] list of all integer bit-hacks (0BSD)
- [ ] implement common bit-hacks (0BSD)
- [ ] verify common bit-hacks (MIT)
- [ ] link or explain common theories and techniques (check license that arxiv uses)
